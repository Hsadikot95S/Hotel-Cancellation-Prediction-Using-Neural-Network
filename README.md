# Hotel-Cancellation-Prediction-Using-Neural-Network

Problem Statement
Tripadvisor has reached out to you. They are dealing with a significant number of last-minute cancellations, therefore they have collected data on each booking. They want to improve the service and are seeking for a way to do it. Your job as an ML Engineer is to forecast whether or not they will cancel the booking based on the features. Predictions must be made using a Neural Network.
